<h2>Game Logic</h2>
<ul>
<li>When the game starts, the player will choose a character by clicking on the fighter's picture. The player will fight as that character for the rest of the game.</li>
<li>The player must then defeat all of the remaining fighters</li>
<li>The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture.</li>
<li>Once the player selects an opponent, that enemy is moved to a defender area.</li>
<li>The player will now be able to click the attack button.</li>
<li>Whenever the player clicks attack, their character damages the defender. The opponent will lose HP (health points). These points are displayed at the bottom of the defender's picture.</li>
